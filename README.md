=====================================================

This is the repository for the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data"

The data being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

This code assumes the data is present together in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

`CodeBook.md` shows the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` is all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in R by sourcing the file.

The file output by the 5th step is `averages_data.txt`. THis was uploaded to the project submission page.
